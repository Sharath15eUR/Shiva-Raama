# MODULE - 5 ASSIGNMENT

### 1. What are the key features of Wi-Fi 6, 6E and 7 and how do they differ from previous standards like Wi-Fi 5 (802.11ac)?
Wi-Fi 6, also known as 802.11ax, brings improvements like OFDMA for better channel sharing, support for uplink MU-MIMO, and features such as BSS Coloring to minimize interference. Wi-Fi 6E expands this by tapping into the newly opened 6 GHz band, offering more spectrum and reducing wireless congestion. Wi-Fi 7 (802.11be) takes things further with technologies like 320 MHz wide channels, 4K-QAM for higher throughput, and Multi-Link Operation, which allows devices to communicate over multiple bands at once. Compared to Wi-Fi 5, these standards provide faster speeds, better capacity, and more efficient use of wireless channels.

### 2. Explain the role of OFDMA in Wi-Fi 6 and how it improves network efficiency.
OFDMA allows a Wi-Fi 6 access point to divide the channel into smaller sub-channels, enabling multiple devices to transmit simultaneously. This contrasts with older Wi-Fi versions, which scheduled one device at a time per channel. By minimizing idle time and reducing the need for devices to compete for access, OFDMA enhances network performance, especially in busy environments.

### 3. Discuss the benefits of Target Wake Time (TWT) in Wi-Fi 6 for IoT devices.
Target Wake Time helps extend battery life by letting devices schedule when they wake up to transmit or receive data. This reduces the time their radios need to be on, which is especially beneficial for battery-powered IoT sensors or smart devices. TWT ensures energy-efficient communication while still maintaining periodic connectivity.

### 4. Explain the significance of the 6 GHz frequency band in Wi-Fi 6E.
Wi-Fi 6E’s access to the 6 GHz spectrum introduces a large, clean bandwidth range that allows for additional high-speed channels. Since this band isn’t shared with legacy devices, it experiences less interference and congestion, supporting faster connections and improved performance for demanding use cases like VR and 4K/8K streaming.

### 5. Compare and contrast Wi-Fi 6 and Wi-Fi 6E in terms of range, bandwidth, and interference.
Both Wi-Fi 6 and 6E use the same core technologies, but Wi-Fi 6E operates on the 6 GHz band while Wi-Fi 6 uses the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands. The higher frequency in Wi-Fi 6E supports more bandwidth but has a shorter effective range and weaker wall penetration. However, because the 6 GHz spectrum is less crowded, Wi-Fi 6E offers cleaner, faster connections in close-range scenarios.

### 6. What are the major innovations introduced in Wi-Fi 7 (802.11be)?
Wi-Fi 7 enhances wireless capabilities with wider 320 MHz channels, higher-order modulation (4K-QAM), and Multi-Link Operation for simultaneous use of multiple frequencies. It also introduces features aimed at reducing latency, such as support for time-sensitive data and better interference handling. These innovations make Wi-Fi 7 suitable for data-intensive and real-time applications.

### 7. Explain the concept of Multi-Link Operation (MLO) and its impact on throughput and latency.
MLO enables devices to use multiple Wi-Fi bands at once to send and receive data. This boosts total bandwidth availability and provides the flexibility to route traffic through the best available link, helping avoid congestion. As a result, MLO improves overall data speeds and ensures lower, more consistent latency.

### 8. What is the purpose of 802.11k and v, and how does it aid in roaming?
802.11k helps clients gather information about nearby access points, allowing smarter roaming decisions. 802.11v complements this by enabling the network to steer clients to better APs based on real-time conditions. Together, they reduce roaming delays and improve the user experience in enterprise or high-density environments.

### 9. Explain the concept of Fast BSS Transition (802.11r) and its benefit in mobile environments.
802.11r allows devices to switch between access points with minimal delay by performing pre-authentication. This quick handoff process helps maintain stable connections during activities like video calls or gaming, where traditional re-authentication would cause interruptions.

### 10. How do 802.11k/v/r work together to provide seamless roaming in enterprise networks?
In combination, 802.11k, 802.11v, and 802.11r optimize the client roaming process. 802.11k collects network information, 802.11v enables the network to recommend the best AP, and 802.11r ensures the switch between APs is quick and secure. This trio ensures smooth connectivity for users moving across large network areas, such as office buildings or campuses.
