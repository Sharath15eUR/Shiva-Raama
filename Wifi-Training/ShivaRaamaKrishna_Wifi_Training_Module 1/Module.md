# WiFi Training Program  
## Assignment Questions â€“ Module 1  

### 1. In which OSI layer does the Wi-Fi standard/protocol fit?  
Wi-Fi operates in:  
- Layer 1 (Physical Layer): Handles radio signal transmission.  
- Layer 2 (Data Link Layer): Divided into:
  - Logical Link Control (LLC)
  - Media Access Control (MAC) for frame addressing and access control.  

### 2. Wi-Fi Devices and Corresponding Generations  
List your daily-use Wi-Fi devices (laptop, smartphone, tablet) and match their Wi-Fi standard:  
- Wi-Fi 4 (802.11n)  
- Wi-Fi 5 (802.11ac)  
- Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax)  

Check device Wi-Fi version:  
- Windows: `netsh wlan show interfaces`  
- Mac: System Report -> Network -> Wi-Fi  

### 3. What is BSS and ESS?  
- BSS (Basic Service Set): A single access point (AP) with connected devices.  
- ESS (Extended Service Set): Multiple APs connected to expand coverage.  

### 4. Basic Functionalities of a Wi-Fi Access Point  
- Provides wireless connectivity.  
- Manages device connections.  
- Supports security protocols (WPA3).  
- Enables multiple SSIDs (guest networks).  

### 5. Difference Between Bridge Mode and Repeater Mode  
| Feature | Bridge Mode | Repeater Mode |
|---------|------------|--------------|
| Purpose | Connects two different networks | Extends Wi-Fi range |
| Use Case | Business/enterprise settings | Home Wi-Fi improvement |

### 6. Differences Between 802.11a and 802.11b  
| Feature | 802.11a | 802.11b |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Frequency | 5 GHz | 2.4 GHz |
| Speed | Up to 54 Mbps | Up to 11 Mbps |
| Range | Shorter | Longer |
| Interference | Less | More |

### 7. Configuring Your Modem/Hotspot to 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz  
#### Steps:  
1. Access router settings via 192.168.1.1.  
2. Navigate to Wireless Settings.  
3. Enable either 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz.  
4. Connect a device and compare:
   - Speed
   - Latency
   - Coverage  

### 8. Difference Between IEEE and WFA  
- IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers): Develops Wi-Fi standards (e.g., IEEE 802.11).  
- WFA (Wi-Fi Alliance): Certifies Wi-Fi devices for compliance.  

### 9. Types of Wi-Fi Internet Connectivity Backhaul  
Backhaul: The connection between an AP and the internet.  
- Fiber Optic: High-speed, reliable.  
- DSL: Slower but widely used.  
- Satellite: For remote areas.  
- Cellular (4G/5G): Used in mobile networks.  

### 10. Wi-Fi Topologies and Use Cases  
- Ad-hoc: Peer-to-peer, no AP, temporary networks.  
- Infrastructure: Standard Wi-Fi with an AP, used in homes/offices.  
- Mesh: Multiple APs for seamless coverage in large areas.
